# Python
to learn Python and store the codes

I will start with some Type-along practises of some tutorials to get familiarised with the basics and then start my own projects.

In progress/done:
Machine Learning with Text in scikit-learn (PyCon 2016) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiKMIuYidY0
(finished the video, except for the exercise)

100 Days Of ML Code https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code
(went through all the info and the codes. Found PythonDataScienceHandbook and the Bloomberg slides useful.

PythonDataScienceHandbook https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/notebooks
